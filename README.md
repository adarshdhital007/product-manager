## https://product-manager-mu.vercel.app/
## A simple CRUD website build with the help of NEXT.js and MongoDB Atlas.Here I have used Tailwind,Next JS and then deployed in Vercel.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
